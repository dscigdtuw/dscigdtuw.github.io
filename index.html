        <center>CODE OF CONDUCT</center>
    </h1>
    <h3><center>Developer Student Clubs IGDTUW</center></h3>
    <p>
        1. Harassment is unwelcome or hostile behaviour, including speech that intimidates, creates
discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation, in a chapter
meeting or chapter event. Harassment in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on
alienage or citizenship, age, colour, creed, disability, marital status, military status, national origin,
pregnancy, childbirth- and pregnancy related medical conditions, race, religion, sex, gender, veteran
status, sexual orientation or any other status protected by laws in which the chapter meeting or
chapter event is being held, will not be tolerated. Harassment includes the use of abusive or
degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical
contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual attention. A response that the participant was “just
joking,” or “teasing,” or being “playful,” will not be accepted. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behaviour should notify a core member of DSC IGDTUW.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Individuals violating these standards may be sanctioned or excluded from further participation at
the discretion of the responsible committee members.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using welcoming and inclusive language
            </li>
            <li>
                Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
            </li>

                Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        6. This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is
representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further
defined and clarified by project maintainers.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by
contacting the project team at dscigdtuw@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The
project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
